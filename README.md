Hello all!

I'm quite happy to share my slide decks with you from the various presentations I do. Enjoy!

However, I would appreciate it very much if you didn't use these to present from yourselves. My slides aren't that special in the first place, so I'm sure you can do better. Plus, putting together a presentation helps you learn better, so copying one is just hurting your own learning.

Thanks!

Grant
