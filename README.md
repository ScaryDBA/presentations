Hello all!

I'm quite happy to share my slide decks with you from the various presentations I do. Enjoy!

However, I would appreciate it very much if you didn't use these to present from yourselves. My slides aren't that special in the first place, so I'm sure you can do better. Plus, putting together a presentation helps you learn better, so copying one is just hurting your own learning.

Currently, I'm storing PDF files of the presentations as is. I will eventually create folders and separate the presentations by topic. So, don't get too used to seeing everything in a big pile.

Thanks!

Grant
